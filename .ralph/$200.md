# Task

Execute **all deferred roadmap milestones** for `pi-orchestrator` across as many iterations as needed, with incremental safe delivery and strict quality gates preserved.

## Goals
- Complete every deferred item in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (not just planning).
- Keep `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and `mutation` passing at every increment.

## Checklist
- [x] Replace placeholder loop template with concrete scope and milestones.
- [x] Select first deferred roadmap item execution target.
- [x] Implement first code slice for selected deferred item.
- [x] Add/extend tests for new behavior.
- [x] Re-run full local quality gate and keep mutation at 100%.
- [x] Implement richer interactive TUI components beyond line widgets.
- [x] Implement automated tuner A/B experiments with rollback policy.
- [x] Implement background health scheduler + escalation loops.
- [x] Implement advanced zellij pane recovery/respawn orchestration.
- [x] Implement richer evidence schema registry + validation diagnostics UI.
- [x] Implement packaged defaults for `.orchestra/project.ts` bootstrap generation command.
- [x] Update PR/branch notes with completed deferred milestone closure.

## Notes
- User clarified: complete **all** roadmap deferred items; do not stop at single-slice planning.
- Iteration 2 delivered health scheduler foundation.
- Iteration 3 completed automated health escalation behavior.
- Iteration 4 completed zellij recovery/respawn orchestration.
- Iteration 5 completed tuner A/B automation + rollback policy.
- Iteration 6 completed richer interactive dashboard/TUI layer.
- Iteration 7 completed evidence schema registry + diagnostics UX.
- Iteration 8 completed packaged defaults/bootstrap milestone:
  - Added `src/project/bootstrap.ts` with `bootstrapProjectConfig()`
    - generates `.orchestra/project.ts` from packaged defaults
    - derives default name from `package.json` when available
    - supports safe skip/force overwrite and targeted overrides
  - Added extension tool `orchestra_project_bootstrap`
  - Added slash command `/orchestra project-bootstrap [force]`
  - Kept project config reloading deterministic after bootstrap write
  - Added tests `tests/project-bootstrap.test.ts`
- Branch notes closure:
  - Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` to mark all previously deferred milestones as completed and set remaining deferred items to none.
- Final validation after milestone closure:
  - `npm run lint` ✅
  - `npm run typecheck` ✅
  - `npm test` ✅ (74 tests)
  - `npm run test:mutate` ✅ (100.00%, 539/539 killed)

## Completion
All roadmap deferred milestones are now implemented and validated under strict quality gates.
