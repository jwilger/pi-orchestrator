# Requirements Workbench

This directory contains requirements artifacts generated via Orchestra discovery
and planning workflows.

## Active requirement tracks

- `lights-out-autonomy-discovery.md` — stakeholder intent, problem framing,
  non-goals, and open questions for autonomy-by-default behavior.
- `lights-out-autonomy-planning.md` — requirement backlog (R1-R7) and
  acceptance criteria for requirements completion.

Use these docs as the canonical input for implementation slices.
